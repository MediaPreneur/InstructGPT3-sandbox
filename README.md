# InstructGPT3-sandbox
 This originally started as a fork of [bkane1's gpt3-sandbox](https://github.com/bkane1/gpt3-sandbox), but it has since been fully recreated in StreamLit. The goal is to use GPT-3 to answer high school discussion questions. A future version of this project will use a fine-tuned GPT2 model for this purpose.

So far so good.

## How to use:
1. Install `requirements.txt`
2. Create `config.py` in the root folder. 
3. The only line you need in there is `api_key = "[KEY]"`. 
4. Replace `[KEY]` with your OpenAi API key.
5. Enter `streamlit run ./streamlit_main.py` into your console.
